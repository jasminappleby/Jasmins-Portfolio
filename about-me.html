                <h5 class="card-title">My Life</h5>
                <p class="card-text">Born on June 26th 2000 in Luton, Bedfordshire. I spent 18 years of my life solely in Luton.</p>
                <p class="card-text">Throughout my childhood, I collected plushies, played video games and ate pizza... not much has changed.</p>
                <p class="card-text">In 2018, I flew the nest and decided to go to University, De Montfort University in Leicester. This is where I studied Computer Science for three years.</p>
                <p class="card-text">Moving to University was my first time living in and renting a place to live. Besides the pandemic, I really enjoyed the freedom I got from living away from home.</p>
                <p class="card-text">Now, I am currently swinging inbetween both Luton and Leicester, because both are home to me!</p>

                <h5 class="card-title">My Hobbies</h5>
                <p class="card-text">I live and breathe video games, primarily those that are on Nintendo consoles. The first Pokemon game I ever played was Pokemon Channel on the GameCube, and the first main series game I remember fully completing on my own was Pokemon Diamond.</p>
                <p class="card-text">Animal Crossing is also a massive passion of mine, as it had been a game I have continously played from extremely young. This is a game I also enjoy making content about on my YouTube channel whenever my laptop co-operates and allows me to use my editing software.</p>
                <p class="card-text">Besides gaming, I enjoy to watch various sports. The Hatters are my team, because I was a season ticket holder for various years of my childhood, and its my roots. I have been following American Football more recently too, with Miami Dolphins being my team!</p>
